# Traffic Sign Classifier


Traffic sign classifier learning architecture is based on the LeNet-5 neural network architecture.

## Architecture
**Layer 1: Convolution** with strides=1 and output shape 28x28x12. **relu activation** and **pooling** output 14x14x12.

**Layer 2: Convolution** with strides=1 and output shape 10x10x32. **relu activation** and **pooling** output 5x5x32 and **flatten** shape 800 outputs

**Layer 3: Fully Connected** with 240 outputs and **relu activation**

**Layer 4: Fully Connected** with 168 outputs, **relu activation** and **dropout**

**Layer 5: Fully Connected** with 43 (n_classes) outputs

## Input
The input is a 32x32xC with C = 3 color channels.

## Ouput
Returns the results of Layer 5

## Data
Jittered images were generated by rotating randomly between [-20,-15,-10,-5,5,10,15,20] degrees with a random perturb in the x and y direction of [0,2] pixels applied. The jittered data was then split randomily with 90% to train and 10 % to test. This resulted in a training set of 122633 with 13626 for validation test.
y values are one hot encoded as tensorflow variables later.

## Model parameters
The adam optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0.001. Batchsize was 1000 with 30 epochs and dropout rate of .25. Weights were initialised with truncated_normal and mu = 0, sigma = 0.1.
